# Pokemon
Let's Play Pokemon!

Just kidding, but being a big fan of battling, i want to do some EDA and build a classifier that can predict legendary pokemon.

# Dataset
Full Gen 1 - 7 dataset can be found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/rounakbanik/pokemon).
But this dataset is missing megas, so it must be joined on  [Gilles Armand's dataset](https://gist.github.com/armgilles/194bcff35001e7eb53a2a8b441e8b2c6).
